String directives in C.
NOTE that
(1)some compiler does NOT support directives for string.
(2)I don't recommend to use it since it make the code less readable.

(1)For a string, use #
(2)To concatenate two string use ##

For example,
if we define a macro,
#define str(x) #x

this statement
cout << str(test);
would be translated into:
cout << "test";

For example,
if we define a macro,
#define glue(a,b) a ## b

this statement
glue(c,out) << "test";
would also be translated into:
cout << "test";
